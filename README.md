## IoT Cloud Platforms Selector

The IoT Cloud Platforms Selector tool was developed as part of the scientific paper entitled 'A Comprehensive Evaluation of IoT Cloud Platforms: A Feature-Driven Review with a Decision-Making Tool', which has been submitted to Sensors and is currently under review. The tool provides a practical application of the article's methodology, facilitating the objective evaluation and selection of IoT cloud platforms based on specific features and requirements. Drawing on a thorough literature review and multi-criteria analysis, the tool helps researchers and industry experts identify the most suitable platform for their projects by taking into account technical, functional and quality parameters.
